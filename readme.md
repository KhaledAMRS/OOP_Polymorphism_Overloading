## Definitions
**Polymorphism (multiple forms):** It comes from the Greek words “poly” (meaning many) and “morphe” (which means form).
<br><br>

*Overloading:*
<br>
It allows us to have multiple definitions for the same method.
The methods must have different signatures, which means they take different parameters and/or they have different return types.

<br><br>
*Examples of Built-in Methods Overloading:*
<br>
Example 1: Implicit wait in Selenium. Implicit wait is an example of overloading. 
Because we use different time stamps such as SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS etc.,
<br>
Example 2: Assert class in TestNG is also an example of overloading.

<br><br>
*Examples of User-defined Methods Overloading:*
<br>
Example 1: Check setCredentials() method in LoginPage class of this project
[LoginPage.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2FLoginPage.java)
